# Ideas, TODOs, and Known Issues

## Known Issues

  - Fix the "City of", "Land of" bug in the quest area regex. It doesn't always grab the whole location name.


## TODOs

  - Make sure all chat channels are properly captured.
  - Capture other events (Hero, Legend, etc.)
  - Clean up the top container notifications. Maybe split the top with an HBox?
    - This would allow for static notifications on the right and quest, etc. stuff on the left.
  - Add expeditions, junkyards, and piligrimage details to the top container.
  - Create a lower right container for weather.
  - Add current debuffs to the bottom or right side of the bottom container.
  - Work on UI help files.

  - [X] DONE - Create an echo prefix for information coming from the UI: -=[UI]=-  
  - [X] DONE -  Re-Colorize pet HP.
  - [X] DONE -  Add the rest of the long class/subclass names (>10 chars) to the left container Class section.
  - [X] DONE -  Implement a theming system!


## Ideas

  - Get the Mudlet mapper setup.
  - Track AutoSkill and KillSkill.
  - Add weather and moon cycles to the lower right.
  - Add a Global Quest alert for your level range.
  - Add a spot to list all mobs in a room.
    - Maybe move Events to the top container and use its left space as a mob list?
